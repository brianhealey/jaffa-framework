What's New
=====================================================
- Changed the '4-rules-aop.xml' rules file to use the new MetaDataLoader
- Upgraded to the latest stable version jboss-aop_1.5.6.GA
- Created showRules.jsp, which can be used as a debug tool for displaying metadata and bindings for a class
- Created a ScriptHelper which utilizes the scripting support new in Java6. It replaces the old BSFHelper
- Replaced bsh-2.0b2.jar with bsh-2.0b5.jar, since it provides the implementation for the Java6 ScriptEngine

  - Introduced a 'criteria' realm that maps to Finder, Lookup, Viewer and GraphCriteria

- The execution-realm for the mandatory rule has now been set to 'business'

What's Deleted/Deprecated
=====================================================
