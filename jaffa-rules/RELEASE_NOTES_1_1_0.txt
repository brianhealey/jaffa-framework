Welcome to JAFFA - Java Application Framework For All
=====================================================

These are the changes made for the JAFFA Rules 1.1.0 Release (Since v1.0.0). For more information visit us at http://jaffa.sourceforge.net


What's New
=====================================================
- Added the HyperlinkPropertyRule. This will be used by the TextTag to generate hyperlinks based on the <hyperlink> rules defined for a property

What's Changed / Improvements
=====================================================
- JaffaRules is now base-lined off JBoss AOP 1.3
- Each class that has rules is added to the implicit include list
- JaffaRules is now base-lined off JBoss AOP 1.3.1, the Initialize rule has been updated to use the 'constructor()' pointcut. This means that we no longer need to use the reflection aspect.
- Enhanced the JaffaClassMetaDataLoader to generate the JBossAOP equivalent synatx of the jaffa rules. This new feature is enabled by passing the system property 'jaffa.aop.jbossAOPSyntaxFile', which should point to a File for writing the syntax to.
- Applied a temporary hack to JaffaClassMetaDataLoader to support inheritance
  - It changes a pointcut to a method, if that method is only implemented in a base class
  - This hack can be disabled by setting the internal static c_applyInheritanceHack to false
  - JBoss is expected to fix the inheritance issues in their next jboss-aop_2.0 release, at which point this hack should be disabled.
  - Created a property 'classNameForInheritanceHack' in the RuleInterceptor class to support the InheritanceHack


What's Deleted/Deprecated
=====================================================
- Deprecated org.jboss.aop.JaffaClassAdvisorHelper, move to new package org.jaffa.rules.aop.metadata.ClassAdvisorHelper
- Removed IEnforceRules class. It has been redundant for a long time, since the JaffaClassMetaDataLoader was modified to mixin the various Interfaces via its INTRODUCTIONS field. All references to IEnforceRules have been removed

Bug Fixes
=====================================================
- JBoss bug JBAOP-139 fixed as of 1.3, removing the need for source\ext\jboss\java\org\jboss\aop\AspectManager.java. There is no need for the Ant Task "compileJBoss","buildJarJbossAop", and no need to deploy jboss-aop-custom.jar
- Fixed NPE thrown by ClassAdvisorHelper.debugListInterceptors when using v1.3.1
