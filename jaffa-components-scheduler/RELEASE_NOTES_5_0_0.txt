Welcome to JAFFA - Java Application Framework For All
=====================================================

These are the changes made for the next release. For more information visit us at http://jaffa.sourceforge.net


What's New
=====================================================
- Upgraded to Java6
  - Regenerated JAXB bindings
- Added a Heartbeat feature to JaffaComponentsScheduler which can be useful for checking the health of the Scheduler
  - The SchedulerHelper supports the following new operations
    - createHeartbeat: to submit a test Job to the Scheduler
    - getHeartbeat: to check the status of the Job
    - deleteHeartbeat: to delete the Job
  - QuartzSchedulerHelper has been enhanced to implement the new operations
  - The new feature is purely for Test purpose, and is available via the tests/scheduler/status.jsp
  - Refactored TaskMaintenanceTx, moving the createTask/updateTask related logic to the QuartzSchedulerHelper

What's Changed / Improvements
=====================================================
- The ClientError from Quartz is now propagated as a ApplicationException, which is then displayed to the user.

What's Deleted/Deprecated
=====================================================

Bug Fixes
=====================================================
- Removed the 'recurrence' PropertyTag from the jsp for the Scheduler.TaskMaintenance component. This ensures that the data-types for the sub-fields within each recurrence-type are not incorrect.
