Welcome to JAFFA - Java Application Framework For All
=====================================================

These are the changes made for the next release. For more information visit us at http://jaffa.sourceforge.net


What's New
=====================================================
- Moved the 'org.jaffa.soa' package from JaffaCore to the JaffaSOA module.
- *The servlet-based SOAEventServer has been deprecated. Instead a scheduler-based SOAEventPoller has been created.
- *Drools has been integrated into the handling of SOAEvents
  - *The SOAEventPoller writes SOAEventQueueMessages to an "internal" Queue
  - *The SOAEventHandler handles the SOAEventQueueMessages, by invoking Drools on the messages
  - *Rules may be written to inspect the SOAEventQueueMessages, and under certain scenarios, publish equivalent SOAEventMessages to a Topic for invoking outbound interfaces

What's Changed / Improvements
=====================================================
- The default AgentEventListener used by the RuleAgent writes event logs to System.err, which is highly undesirable. Modified ServiceRulesInterceptor to create a custom AgentEventListener implementation, that logs various events via Log4J.

What's Deleted/Deprecated
=====================================================

Bug Fixes
=====================================================
- Corrected the ServiceRulesInterceptor to invoke an 'update' on an existing FactHandle, instead of modifyRetract+modifyInsert. This ensures that modifications to a Fact activate the necessary rules.
