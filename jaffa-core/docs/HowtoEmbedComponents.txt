Howto embed components within a component to render a screen comprising JSPs from multiple components
=====================================================================================================

Example
=======
- Lets assume we have the classes - ParentComponent, ChildComponent1, ChildComponent2
- The ParentComponent will have a screen containing some fields + 2 buttons
- Hitting button1 will render a screen from ChildComponent1 below the ParentComponent fields
- Hitting button2 will render a screen from ChildComponent2 below the ParentComponent fields
- The events generated by the ParentComponent JSP will be handled by the ParentComponent's event handler
- The events generated by the ChildComponent JSP will be handled by the ChildComponent's event handler



Steps
======
- Add the property 'currentIncludedScreenFormKey' of type 'FormKey' to the ParentComponent
- When instantiating ChildComponent1 and ChildComponent2, the ParentComponent will invoke the setContainerFormKey() on the child components, passing 'aFormKeyForLayoutScreen'
- When instantiating ChildComponent1 and ChildComponent2, the ParentComponent will invoke addFormKeyChangeListener() on the child components. This listener will update the 'currentIncludedScreenFormKey' with the 'FormKey' passed via the FormKeyChangeEvent object
- The value of 'aFormKeyForLayoutScreen' should point to some layout JSP
- The layout JSP will INCLUDE the screen for the ParentComponent
- The layout JSP will then invoke request.setAttribute(FormKey.class.getName(), currentIncludedScreenFormKey)
- Finally the layout JSP will use the 'currentIncludedScreenFormKey' to INCLUDE the appropriate screen of the child component


Notes
=====
- The invocation of the setContainerFormKey() method ensures that the layout JSP is rendered whenever a FormKey for the child component is returned by any event handler
- The invocation of the request.setAttribute() method ensures that the child screen is correctly rendered
- Tiles may be used for including the JSPs within the layout JSP.
