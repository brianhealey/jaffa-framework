-  The Finder/Lookup patterns were enhanced by caching UP entities while generating the results, so that multiple queries are not performed on the same data instance 
-  Added the descending sort and default sort capabilities to the Finder and Lookup patterns

What's Deleted/Deprecated
=====================================================

Bug Fixes
=====================================================
General Bug Fixes: 
-  Updated Copyright to reference 'All' instead of 'Aerospace' 
-  The build scripts have been fixed to execute tasks for WindowsXP 
-  Fixed the JaffaJAR and JaffaToolsJAR target in the build script to also include DTD files 
-  Fixed the MessageHelper to not pass null arguments when invoking the MessageResources 
-  Removed the reference to the deprecated class HttpUtils from URLHelper 
-  Fixed the build script to have 'debug' and 'deprecation' turned on, when creating the JARs 
-  Fixed the build scripts to exclude the pesky Windows XP file 'Thumbs.db' from the distributables 
-  Fixed the Finder component to determine the values displayed in the MaxRecords dropdown in a Finder/Lookup, through a framework property 
-  Changed CustomException to use the java 1.4 getCause() inner exception 
-  Added fixes to allow mbean creation in Tomcat 1.4.24 

Persistence Bug Fixes: 
-  Fixed the DataSourceCursor to wrap the call to 'setFetchSize' in a try-catch block, since all drivers do not implement the feature (eg.Postgresql) 
-  Fixed JdbcSecurityPluginFactory such that an exception will no longer be raised, if the property 'framework.persistence.jdbcengine.security.plugin' is not specified in framework.properties 

Patterns Bug Fixes: 
-  The Finder/Lookup patterns were fixed to bring up related Viewers in a new browser window 
-  The Finder/Lookup patterns were fixed to bring up a 'confirm' message before deleting a record 
-  Fixed the ConfigFileUpdate to correctly handle filenames having spaces 
-  Fixed the Uniface domainmeta tool to allow customization of the 'CaseType' attribute of a field 
-  Fixed the Uniface domainmeta tool to refer to Field Interface Templates while processing a table 
-  The JDOMParser was replaced by a new class DomParser, which uses the Java1.4 API for XML parsing, instead of JDOM 

Presentation Bug Fixes: 
-  Eventhandling has been fixed to put the desired FormKey on the request stream, instead of setting the 'CurrentFormKey' property on the UserSession 
-  Fixed the error handling mechanism in FormBase to be more consistent with Struts 
-  Fixed the UserGridManager to not raise warnings if the UserGridSettings file is not found 
-  Fixed the Tags to implement the TryCatchFinally interface, since the JSP spec no longer guarantees the invocation of the release() method 
-  Fixed the TextTag to replace the EndOfLine characters with the <BR> tag 
-  Fixed a few UserGrid bugs to make the widget more robust 
-  The UserGrid was fixed to allow disabling hints 
-  Fixed the lookup.jsp to correctly handle double-quotes 
-  Fixed the javascript to include input fields of type 'password' in the logic that traps the key presses, so that auto-enter works for password fields 
-  Improved error handling in the Tags when the WidgetModel in the formbean is not the correct class for the widget consuming the model. It will now give a sencible message when the exception is thrown
