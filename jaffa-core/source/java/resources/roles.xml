<!-- This is an empty role definition file, it will be loaded if you don't specify one
     in the framework.properties file.
     
     This default one does not declare any roles, and hence if you use this and put
     no mandatory constraints on the components in the components.xml file, then 
     your application will be effectivly bypassing the security system

    <!-- Below is an example of what a real role definition file will look like.
       - 
       - Based on how you declare your roles and assign them to users, you may want to duplicate 
       - definitions per role, such that the manager include all the functions of the CLERK and SUPERVISOR,
       - and you just grant the MANAGER role to the user.
       - If you defined them like the example below, you can say that if a user is a manager then he
       - is granted the roles of CLERK, SUPERVISOR and MANAGER. This remove additional duplication in this
       - ploicy definition file.
       - 
       
        <role name="Clerk">
            <description>This is a clerk</description>
        </role>
        <role name="Supervisor">
            <grant-function-access name="payroll.viewSalary"/>
            <grant-function-access name="payroll.transactionOverride"/>
        </role>
        <role name="Manager">
            <description>This is a Manager</description>
            <grant-function-access name="payroll.updateSalary"/>
            <grant-function-access name="payroll.printWages"/>
        </role>
