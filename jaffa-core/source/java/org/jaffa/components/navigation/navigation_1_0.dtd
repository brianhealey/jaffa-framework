<!-- The global-menu is the top level menu, and its list of options will be listed
     horizontally across the page. Each top level menu option should be defined with
     a sub-menu, to provide the initial list of drop-down options

<!ELEMENT global-menu ( menu-option+ )>

<!-- A menu-option is used to define an option on both the 'global navigation menu' and on 
     the 'desktop navigation menu'. There are four options here, 
     component-action,
     	- which is a direct link to run a Jaffa Component
     url-action,
     	- which can directly run a URL. This can be a relative or absolute href, or could
          even be a "javascript:" based url to call client side code.
     sub-menu,
     	- which is used to describe a lower level list of menu options
     desktop-menu,
     	- which is only used in a 'global navigation menu', to infer that the
          these menu options are not part of the global menu, but are the root of 
          a desktop level menu. A definition of a desktop-menu from within a desktop
          menu will be treated as if it were just a 'sub-menu' definition.
