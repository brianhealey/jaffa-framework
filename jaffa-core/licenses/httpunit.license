HttpUnit (http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/) is a free, open source
(http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/doc/license.html) Java API for accessing web sites without
a browser, and is ideally suited for automated unit testing of web sites when combined with
a Java unit test framework such as JUnit(http://www.junit.org/index.htm). It was designed and
implemented by Russell Gold (russgold@users.sourceforge.net)
