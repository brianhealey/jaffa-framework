    <h1>Mult-Grouping Grid Extension - Live Data Example</h1>
    <p>
    This is another example of the Multiple Grid Extention (See <a href="MultiGroup.html">basic example</a>)
    <br/>
    It is based on getting the data from a back end live data source is "chunks", and doing server side sorting.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Below is a working Example...</h2>
    <p><b>Note: </b>Must be deployed on a JSP based server to work as as that is used as the dummy data source<p>

    <hr/>
    <div id="multiGroupEx1"></div>
    <hr/>

    <p>This example is based on the JaffaRIA deployment bundle which includes the full version of ExtJS 2.x, along
    with the many extensions that have been added as part of JaffaRIA.</p>
    <p>JaffaRIA can be downloaded and built from the CVS source,
    or daily builds can found at <a href="http://jaffa.sf.net/repository/" target='_blank'>http://jaffa.sf.net/repository/</a><p>

    <h2>Example source code can be found here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://jaffa.cvs.sourceforge.net/jaffa/JaffaRIA/source/html/tests/extjs/multigroup/MultiGroupLive.html?view=markup" target='_blank'>tests/extjs/multigroup/MultiGroup.html</a></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Change Log</h2>
    <ul type="1">
      <li>Implemented a new panel MultiGroupingPagingPanel that handles all the new events to page the data in as you are
          scrolling. It also added to the panel's bottom tool bar to provide record count status and a manual button to
          get the next page. 
      <li>Implemented the server-side interface for the store so that it passed 'start' and 'limit' and 'sort'.
          Sort now contains a comma seperated list of fields to sort by, optionally suffixed with ASC or DESC. 
          This list is made up from the group fields and the single column sort field.
      <li>Added a new attribute 'incomplete' to the information available to the groupTemplate, this example uses a "+"
          to indicate the group is incomplete, and supresses the calculation of a group total
      <li>Implemented a JSP backed by a CSV file of data to remove the need for a live database to test this. This JSP
          simulates multi column sorting, column filtering (based on a beginsWith clause) and support the start and limit parameters
      <li>Implements a "dirty" data check, whereby it reads one more row that it is displaying so it knows if there is more data,
          and then uses this row to make sure it matches the first row returned when asking for the next page. A mismatch will
          cause a complete re-retrieve of all data             
    </ul>  
    <h2>Known Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Not all columns returned may be supported by the server-side sorting, these columns can't be grouped by.
      <li>There may be cases when the field name need by the 'sort' is not the same as the one used in the columns 'dataIndex'
    </ul>  
    <h2>Planned/Requested Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add in an example that uses filters
      <li>Add in an example that will use a DWR based proxy to invoke a 
    </ul>
